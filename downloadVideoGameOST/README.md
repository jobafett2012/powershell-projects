# Download Video Game Soundtracks

Go to https://downloads.khinsider.com/

Find the album or albums you want, copy the full URL's and put them in the $URLS array

Sidenote, this site is somewhat inconsistent with naming and mp3 tags.

  Filenames sometimes have double encoded URL characters in them, resulting in some oddly named downloaded files
